User flow

1. Index page loads in user browser
2. User clicks a link and History (interacts with the URL) picks up the new URL and passes it along to the ReactRouter which updates the react components shown on the screen, depending on the URL
3. React renders the updated components
4. Updated content is displayed on the new URL
